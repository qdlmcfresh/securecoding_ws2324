    "In this example we want to attack an AES encryption using the _Differential-Power-Analysis_ introduces by Kocher et al. 1999.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Differential-Power-Analysis has few prerequisites or in other words: It can be applied if the following conditions hold true:\n",
    "- The device holds a **secret** (e.g. a key)\n",
    "- The **secret is constant** during all measurements\n",
    "- External **varying input** can be fed into the device\n",
    "- The secret \"**collides**\" with external input\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- \"Collide\" means: The input and the secret are processed together in an algorithm\n",
    "- Varying input: It is not required that the input can be determined by the attacker. It is sufficient that the attacker knows the input and the input is sufficiently random.\n",
    "- If the input is unknown but varying the attack also works if the output is known by the attacker."
